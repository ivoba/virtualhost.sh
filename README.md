This is fork from: https://github.com/pgib/virtualhost.sh
and there from the ubuntu branch: https://github.com/pgib/virtualhost.sh/tree/ubuntu

It adds a installer script for symfony 1.4 that afterwards calls a modified version of this neat virtualhost creator script.
Its designed for Ubuntu.

Its supposed to let you start a new symfony 1.4 project on your ubuntu dev machine "rapido"!

It fetches the latest symfony 1.4 from the subversion repo, goes through all necessary steps for a project setup and creates a virtualhost on your dev machine.
